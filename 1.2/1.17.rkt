; Exercise 1.17
; The exponentiation algorithms in this section are based on performing
; exponentiation by means of repeated multiplication. In a similar way, one can
; perform integer multiplication by means of repeated addition. The following
; multiplication procedure (in which it is assumed that our language can only
; add, not multiply) is analogous to the expt procedure:

(define (* a b)
  (if (= b 0)
      0
      (+ a (* a (- b 1)))))

; This algorithm takes a number of steps that is linear in b. Now suppose we
; include, together with addition, operations double, which doubles an integer,
; and halve, which divides an (even) integer by 2. Using these, design a
; multiplication procedure analogous to fast-expt that uses a logarithmic
; number of steps.‚Äù

(define (double x) (+ x x))
(define (halve x) (/ x 2.0))

(define (fast-*-iter a b sum)
  (cond ((= b 0) sum)
        ((even? b) (fast-*-iter a (halve b) (double sum)))
        (else (fast-*-iter a (- b 1) (+ sum a)))))

(define (fast-* a b)
  (fast-*-iter a b 0))
