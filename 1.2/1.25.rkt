; Exercise 1.25
; Alyssa P. Hacker complains that we went to a lot of extra work in writing
; expmod. After all, she says, since we already know how to compute
; exponentials, we could have simply written

(define (expmod base exp m)
  (remainder (fast-expt base exp) m))

; Is she correct? Would this procedure serve as well for our fast prime tester?
; Explain.

(define (fast-expt b n)
  (cond ((= n 0)
         1)
        ((even? n)
         (square (fast-expt b (/ n 2))))
        (else
         (* b (fast-expt b (- n 1))))))
(define (square x) (* x x))

; If m = 0 in expmod, this version crashes but since in Fermat test n is a
; prime, most likely 0 will never be tested since it's known to not be a prime
; Hence the version Alyssa P. Hacker proposes produces correct results. However,
; if we run search-for-primes with this version of expmod, we see it takes
; considerably longer to produce results. This is because the previous version
; of the expmod took a modulo before returning, hence keeping return values of
; expmod smaller than m at each step. With Alyssa's version, fast-exp calculates
; giant numbers at intermediate steps, hence taking a lot longer at especially
; larger values.
