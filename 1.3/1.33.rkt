; Exercise 1.33
; You can obtain an even more general version of accumulate (Exercise 1.32) by
; introducing the notion of a filter on the terms to be combined. That is,
; combine only those terms derived from values in the range that satisfy a
; specified condition. The resulting filtered-accumulate abstraction takes the
; same arguments as accumulate, together with an additional predicate of one
; argument that specifies the filter. Write filtered-accumulate as a procedure.
; Show how to express the following using filtered-accumulate:‚Äù
;   1. the sum of the squares of the prime numbers in the interval a to b
;      (assuming that you have a prime? predicate already written)
;   2. the product of all the positive integers less than n that are relatively
;      prime to n (i.e., all positive integers i<n such that GCD(i,n)=1).
