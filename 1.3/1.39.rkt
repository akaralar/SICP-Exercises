; Exercise 1.39
; A continued fraction representation of the tangent function was published in
; 1770 by the German mathematician J.H. Lambert:
; tan x = x / (1 - (x^2 / (3 - (x^2 / (5 - ..., where x is in radians.
; Define a procedure (tan-cf x k) that computes an approximation to the tangent
; function based on Lambertâ€™s formula. k specifies the number of terms to
; compute, as in Exercise 1.37.
